          <h2>With the help of us and your surrounding community we will locate your lost pet.</h2>

            <p>Pet SearchTeam is a platform from which people can create alerts that their pets have gone missing or have run away. Using our website allows you to interact with dozens of people within your community who are committed to helping people find lost pets. Our chat and map services indicate when and where pets have gone missing, where they may have been seen, or even if they've been found. Since Pet SearchTeam's inception in 1993 we have successfully located and safely returned a wide range of pets to their owners.</p>

            <p>This is a community based website and it relys on the users to be successful. It is important that you are very specific when describing your pet in an alert. Your alert will be sent to anyone with an account within five miles of your location via email and also alerts if you have the app. SearchTeams strive in numbers! The more people we have within our database the more successful our searches will be. Keep your eyes peeled and put the word out! Your community thanks you. </p>
