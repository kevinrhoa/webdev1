                                <p><b>Kevin Rhoa</b> is a student at Columbia College in Chicago, Illinois studying interactive design. Born in Cleveland, Ohio the Midwest is home to him. Kevin chased different careers in college such as urban planning and film in both Cleveland and Chicago before committing to his current path. His interests in this field range from writing programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. to more creative aspects such as animation, graphic design, and UX. Some of these skills are demonstrated right here on this site, which Kevin personally designed and built from start to finish.</p>

                                <p><b>Websites</b> are essential for young professionals and artists in the world today and Kevin wants to build one for you. Maybe you're a fellow student looking for more exposure between you and your peers or potential employers. You may have a business that needs a strong and reliable website which will show clients and customers who you are and what you stand for. You could be a photographer or artist looking to effectively showcase your portfolio. Maybe your a musician seeking more transparency with your audience. All of these ambitions can be achieved through the right design and development of your website. Let's connect.  </p>

His photography can be viewed here on this site via the gallery. He is also a multi-instrumentalist. Writing music is another thing Kevin rushes to whenever he gets the chance. With time on his side there are plenty more skills to be learned and things to create in the future.  </p>
